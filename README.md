# 🎮 BombPrice

## Overview:
This project aims to integrate the OpenSea API and Bcrypt API requests to verify and validate hero NFTs listed on the market within the Web3 ecosystem, particularly targeting the game BombCrypto.

## Problem Statement:
During the transition of the game to a new phase, the OpenSea collection failed to display images and data of the characters. To address this issue, this application was developed to pull mass data of heroes listed on OpenSea and provide comprehensive information about them, including attributes, rarity, and more.

## 🚀  Features:
- ✅ Integration of OpenSea API: Fetching data of hero NFTs from the OpenSea marketplace.
- ✅ Bcrypt API Requests: Ensuring the security and authenticity of hero NFTs through validation.
- ✅ Mass Data Retrieval: Pulling extensive information about heroes listed on OpenSea to fill the gap in the collection display.
- ✅ Comprehensive Insights: Providing users with detailed attributes, rarity, and other relevant data for each hero NFT.
- 🟧 Real-time synchronization of all listed NFTs on OpenSea via direct integration with the Polygon Network, instead of OpenSea API.
- 🟧 Verified ✔! Curated list of manually verified heroes or houses acknowledged as authentic NFTs. 
- 🟧 Dedicated user interface where players can input OpenSea links of NFTs (houses or heroes) for automated authenticity validation.
